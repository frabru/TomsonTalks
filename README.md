# TomsonTalks
A free and open comic lettering font

## Files

**TomsonTalks.svg** is the original source file. The glyph outlines are SVG paths that use a combination of cubic bézier curves, quadratic bézier curves, and elliptic arcs which can't be directly represented in any other format. So do not generate the SVG font from any of the other files.

**FONTLOG.txt** documents changes as suggested by SIL.

**OFL.txt** is the SIL Open Font License. A copy of the **OFL-FAQ.txt** is also included.

**TomsonTalks.sfd** is a hand-fixed FontForge-import of the SVG font file. The last time I did this I found that FontForge failed to export space characters (characters with only an advance width but no outline data) properly if I don't manually edit them once. That's something to look out for if you intend to import the SVG file yourself. I also included the FONTLOG in the SFD file.

**TomsonTalks.otf**, **TomsonTalks.eot**, and **TomsonTalks.ttf** are generated from the SFD file and are not intended as sources for further processing.

## Character set

**Tomson Talks** is an all caps font. Letters and puctuation marks are added mostly because I expect to use them. The font has currently no full coverage of any ISO character set or any Unicode block.
