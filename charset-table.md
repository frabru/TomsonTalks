# Tomson Talks 1.1 character set

**Tomson Talks** is an all caps font. All lowercase letters marked as supported are mapped to the corresponding uppercase letters. Characters are added mostly because I expect to use them. The font has currently no full coverage of any ISO character set or any Unicode block.

The tables below are organised by Unicode blocks. Characters are styled depending on status:

- __supported__
- ~~unsupported~~

For spaces and invisible characters the character name is added in parenthesis.


## Special Ligatures

The font contains special glyphs for some double consonants. This is intended to make it look more like hand-written text by making instances of the same character look different where it would be most obvious. The double-T is additionally more of a classic use-case for a ligature in that the angle of the horizontal strokes is changed which allows the glyphs to be closer than they otherwise would.

Double consonants with extra glyphs are:

- FF
- LL
- MM
- NN
- RR
- SS
- TT
